# hosts-gen

This  is a simple framework to create your hosts file from many files in
a hosts.d folder. It is usefull especially when you  have  a  frequently
updated  part  of  the  hosts  file,  like a filter list for spam and it
should be integrated into the main hosts file without any manual  inter‐
vention.

There  is  an  »examples«  folder which shows sources for various filter
lists.

## Directory Structure

The  hosts  parts are by default stored in /etc/hosts.d and will be read
according to their standard sort order in ls(1). The file names have the
form  of ’^[0‐9]*‐[^ ]’ (see the etc/hosts.d dir for the standard header
and the localhost). Files can be easily excluded from being run  by  re‐
moving the numbers in front of their name.

## How it works

Install hosts-gen

	sudo make install

Just run

	hosts-gen

in  some  hook,  manually or as cronjob and your /etc/hosts file will be
generated.
